## Introduction

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any location in the world. The application is built using Python FastAPI for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features

- Search for current weather by city name
- Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices
- Fast and efficient API responses

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js (for frontend dependencies if any)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neuvillete/Weather-Dashboard.git
   cd weather-dashboard
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. If you have any frontend dependencies managed via npm or yarn, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install  # or `yarn install`
   ```

3. Serve the frontend files using a simple HTTP server or your preferred method:
   ```bash
   npx http-server .  # or `python -m http.server`
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the backend API.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port you chose) to access the frontend interface.
3. Enter a city name in the search bar and get real-time weather information.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API:** [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
